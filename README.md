This is an introductory website. In it, I will demonstrate what I have learned so far. As an aside, I will also change the background color and font color, so that it is more pleasant on the eyes than the blinding white background of most basic web pages. 

Besides changing the background/font color, I will be embedding images, creating lists (organized and unorganize), using emphasized and strong text tags, as well making sure to include the appropriate boilerplate for my website.
