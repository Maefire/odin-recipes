    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A flavorful variation of <em>traditional</em> Chili Mac. This recipe includes shredded mix of Mexican style 4 cheese. Most of the recipe is done on a stove, but the last 15 minutes are recommended to be done in the oven for a nice melt of the soon to be <em>creamy</em> cheese. </p>
